## Project NEXT
Project NEXT provides a quick command line tool for GTD enthusiasts and daily practitioners who prefer the speed of text input,
to input and organize their daily tasks in the GTD way.

It provides commands to add tasks into Inbox, and set tasks as Next, Wait, Some(day), Proj(ect), Done. Project can have maximum of 2 layers of nesting. Users can easily put tasks from Inbox to be under any project. With above, GTD flow can be followed completely.

#### Infrastructure contributed
The two big chunks of my code are not features, but 2 major underlying data structures - `GtdThought` and `GtdList` which provide infrastructures / methods for facilities / commands to interact, call and build upon.

To facilitate others to make use of the data structure, add `stream()` support for GtdList.

The idea of keep a `master` list of all level 0 `GtdThought` and a `current` list that keeps track of the latest printed list as a reference for actionable commands.


#### Enhancements implemented

The noble feature I built is called `proj-mode`, which is a command that enters a mode to simplify a complex action, put tasks from Inbox to be under one of all projects. Generally, one would think for command line interface to arrange among 2 lists, first need to print list 1 and select items, then print list 2 and select item to perform the action. To avoid vertically print 2 lists one after another which may involve user scrolling back and forth, `proj-mode` prints 2 lists side by side, with such 2-column view, user can use `->` command to transfer items from left list to right list.

DeleteCommand which can delete `GtdThought` of any level. e.g. `delete 1-2-1`

Various bugs fixing among different places.

#### Contributions to team-based tasks
+ set up team organization 
+ my role is to keep track and wipe on the completion of [issues](https://github.com/AY2122S1-TIC4001-F18-3/tp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
+ when team members unable to deliver PR of assigned issues on time, will intervene in order not to miss the deadline (such as DG, UG, DeleteCommand, ListCommand, CI etc)
+ first time set up CI all green, including initial fix of all `checkstyle` with ruiting and `text-ui-test`, maintain all green afterwards
+ perform demo of the product, quick fix of the bugs that show up during the rehearsal of the demonstration
+ release major version `v1.0`, `v1.4`, `v2.0`
+ arrange more than half of the meetings
+ majority of the writing on [google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VIJ82_uYj_6vg6yAU3R6hSfGvMCJIGGmnv1DLWzPNLA/edit?usp=sharing) shared document, including meeting minutes and action deliverables
+ put some real tasks into `next.txt` for some task samples
