## Project: JustBook App v3.0 Overview
JustBook - Version 3.0 is a desktop application typically designed for use by a modern poly or JC student, in 
registering his or her personal bookings or appointments. It leverages on an online database storage facility, backed by
an offline backup file. The user interacts with it using a CLI. It is written in Java(ver. 11), and has about 702 LoC.

### Summary of Contributions
- New Feature: deleting a single appointment
  - For this feature, I implemented this in the DeleteCommand Class. This feature allows the user to delete a specific appointment
  at a specific date. This is useful if the user wishes to delete an appointment from the schedule.

- New Feature: providing instructions for the "help" command
    - This feature is implemented in the HelpCommand Class. This feature prints out instructions about how the command works. This is useful for the user
    if the user has forgotten what are the available commands.
