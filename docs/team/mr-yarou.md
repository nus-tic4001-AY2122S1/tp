## Overview

NUS Mods List is a program to help you choose and organize your NUS modules.

You can view all available modules for the year, as well as add modules you are interested in to your personal list of modules. NUS Mods List also lets you save and load your list, so you can log off the program, log in another time, and still be able to keep the modules you have saved the last time.
