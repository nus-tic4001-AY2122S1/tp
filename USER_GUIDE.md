# User Guide

NUS Mods List is a program to help you choose and organize your NUS modules. 

You can view all available modules for the year, as well as add modules you are interested in
to your personal list of modules. NUS Mods List also lets you save and load your list, so 
you can log off the program, log in another time, and still be able to keep the modules 
you have saved the last time.

Start the program by running the .jar file. When the program is running, you should see this output:

`Welcome to NUS module tracker`

`What can I do for you?`

`Type something:` 

You can now enter commands into the command prompt. 

Here are a list of commands you can enter, and the explanations of what the commands do:
